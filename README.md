# TileDB-BioImaging

Python package for:
- converting images stored in popular Biomedical Imaging formats to groups of TileDB arrays (& vice versa)
- exposing an expressive and efficient API (powered by TileDB) for querying such data.

## Features

### Ingestion to TileDB Groups of Arrays
    - OME-Zarr
    - OME-Tiff
    - Open-Slide

### Export from TileDB-Bioimaging Arrays to:
    - OME-Zarr
    - OME-Tiff

### Visualization Options

- [TileDB Cloud](https://cloud.tiledb.com) includes a built-in, pyramidal multi-resolution viewer: log in to TileDB Cloud to see an example image preview [here](https://cloud.tiledb.com/biomedical-imaging/TileDB-Inc/dbb7dfcc-28b3-40e5-916f-6509a666d950/preview)

## Installation Prerequisites

OpenSlide Python requires that OpenSlide be installed separately prior to its installation.

Prior to proceeding with the below installation instructions, please [install OpenSlide as recommended by the OpenSlide Python library](https://openslide.org/api/python/#:~:text=OpenSlide%20Python%20requires%20OpenSlide%2C%20which%20must%20be%20installed%20separately).

## Quick Installation

- From PyPI:

      pip install 'tiledb-bioimg[full]'

- From source:

      git clone https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/TileDB-BioImaging.git
      cd TileDB-BioImaging

      pip install -e '.[full]'

## Windows Installation

After installing `Openslide` you should make sure that you create a link between your installation path and
the following default path `C:\openslide-win64\ `.

```cmd
mklink /D C:\openslide-win64\ [your-installation-path]\openslide-win64-20221217\
```

You can install the latest versions of `Openslide` for windows using the pre-built packages
found in the project's github page:
`https://github.com/openslide/openslide-bin/releases`

or in their website:
`https://openslide.org/download/`


## Examples
How to convert imaging data from standard biomedical formats to group of TileDB arrays.

### OME-Zarr to TileDB Group of Arrays
```python
from tiledb.bioimg.converters.ome_zarr import OMEZarrConverter
OMEZarrConverter.to_tiledb("path_to_ome_zarr_image", "tiledb_array_group_path")
```

### OME-Tiff to TileDB Group of Arrays
```python
from tiledb.bioimg.converters.ome_tiff import OMETiffConverter
OMETiffConverter.to_tiledb("path_to_ome_tiff_image", "tiledb_array_group_path")
```

### Open Slide to TileDB Group of Arrays
```python
from tiledb.bioimg.converters.openslide import OpenSlideConverter
OpenSlideConverter.to_tiledb("path_to_open_slide_image", "tiledb_array_group_path")
```
